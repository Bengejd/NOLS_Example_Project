## Running NOLS

In a separate terminal window, cd into the project directory. 

#### Start NOLS

nols
```

Select **Default** from the list of modes.

NOLS will ask you if the default entry folder is ok to use, just hit enter.

You will be asked two more questions. Input `812px` for the **viewport height** and `375px` for the **viewport 
width**.

Confirm that the configuration is correct, and let NOLS do it's thing. After NOLS finishes, navigate back to your 
browser, and try out different devices.

You should see that the design shows up the same on any of the mobile devices you choose from.
